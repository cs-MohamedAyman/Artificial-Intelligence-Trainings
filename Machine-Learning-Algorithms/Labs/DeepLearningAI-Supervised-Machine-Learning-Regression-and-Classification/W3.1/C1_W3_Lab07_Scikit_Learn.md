# Ungraded Lab:  Logistic Regression using Scikit-Learn




## Goals
In this lab you will:
-  Train a logistic regression model using scikit-learn.


## Dataset
Let's start with the same dataset as before.


```python
import numpy as np

X = np.array([[0.5, 1.5], [1,1], [1.5, 0.5], [3, 0.5], [2, 2], [1, 2.5]])
y = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1])
```

## Fit the model

The code below imports the [logistic regression model](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html#sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression) from scikit-learn. You can fit this model on the training data by calling `fit` function.


```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

lr_model = LogisticRegression()
lr_model.fit(X, y)
```




    LogisticRegression(C=1.0, class_weight=None, dual=False, fit_intercept=True,
                       intercept_scaling=1, l1_ratio=None, max_iter=100,
                       multi_class='auto', n_jobs=None, penalty='l2',
                       random_state=None, solver='lbfgs', tol=0.0001, verbose=0,
                       warm_start=False)



## Make Predictions

You can see the predictions made by this model by calling the `predict` function.


```python
y_pred = lr_model.predict(X)

print("Prediction on training set:", y_pred)
```

    Prediction on training set: [0 0 0 1 1 1]


## Calculate accuracy

You can calculate this accuracy of this model by calling the `score` function.


```python
print("Accuracy on training set:", lr_model.score(X, y))
```

    Accuracy on training set: 1.0
